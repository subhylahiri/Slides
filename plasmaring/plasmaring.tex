\begin{abstract}
We construct solutions to the relativistic Navier-Stokes equations
that describe the long wavelength collective dynamics of the
deconfined plasma phase of $\CN=4$ Yang Mills theory compactified
down to $d=3$ on a Scherk-Schwarz circle and higher dimensional generalisations. Our solutions are stationary, axially symmetric spinning balls and rings of plasma. These solutions, which are dual to (yet to be constructed) rotating black holes and black rings in Scherk-Schwarz compactified AdS$_5$ and AdS$_6$, and have properties that are qualitatively similar to those of black holes and black rings in flat five dimensional supergravty.

\section{Fluid dynamics}\label{sec:stress}



In this paper we study aspects of the dynamics of the deconfined
plasma described in the previous section. A full accounting for the
dynamics of the `gluon plasma' is a very complicated problem.
However, when the thermodynamic potentials and velocities vary over
length scales large compared to the quasiparticle (`gluon') mean
free path admit an effective description in terms of the equations
of fluid dynamics. The variables in this description are the local
values of the plasma or fluid velocity $u^\mu(x)$ and the plasma
density $\rho(x)$ (the equation of state, as discussed in appendix
\ref{app:eqstate}, may be used to trade the density for the pressure
or the temperature). The equations of fluid dynamics are simply a
statement of the conservation of the stress tensor
%
\begin{equation}\label{Epconsv:eq}
  \nabla_\mu T^{\mu\nu} = \p_\mu T^{\mu\nu}
                        + \Gamma^\mu_{\mu\lambda} T^{\lambda\nu}
                        + \Gamma^\nu_{\mu\lambda} T^{\mu\lambda}
                        = 0\,.
\end{equation}
%
All input of the dynamical nature of the fluid that undergoes this
flow appears in the specification of the stress tensor in terms of
the velocity and density of the fluid, and from the thermodynamic
equation of state (which determines the pressure and temperature as
a function of density). In the rest of this brief subsection we
describe the functional form of the fluid dynamical stress tensor
for our plasma fluid  in detail.

The stress tensor can be split into three parts:
%
\begin{equation*}
  T^{\mu\nu} = T^{\mu\nu}_\mathrm{perfect} +
          T^{\mu\nu}_\mathrm{dissipative} +
          T^{\mu\nu}_\mathrm{surface}.
\end{equation*}
%
The first part, $T^{\mu\nu}_\mathrm{perfect}$, is the stress tensor
for a perfect fluid with no dissipative forces. It is a function
only of fluid velocity and thermodynamic quantities in the rest
frame, and not of their space time derivatives.

The second part, $T^{\mu\nu}_\mathrm{dissipative}$, receives
contributions from viscosity and heat flow. In the long wavelength
limit this piece is linear in the first derivatives of the velocity
and temperature.

The third part, $T^{\mu\nu}_\mathrm{surface}$, represents surface
contributions to the stress tensor, and requires more explanation.
Any fluid configuration with a surface has large variations in (for
instance) the fluid density over the scale of the mean free path, in
directions normal to the surface (see for instance
\cite{Aharony:2005bm}). As a consequence it is impermissable to use
the Navier-Stokes equations for the fluid in the neighbourhood of
the surface. When the deviations of the surface from a straight line
are small over length scale of the mean free path, however, all
effects of the surface may approximately be captured by a delta
function localised `surface tension' contribution,
$T^{\mu\nu}_\mathrm{surface}$, to the stress tensor. In the long
wavelength approximation, this term depends only on the gradients of
the surface and not its curvature.



\subsection{Perfect fluid stress tensor}\label{sec:blkstr}

%The most general ultralocal stress tensor one can build out of the
%fluid velocity is
%%
%\begin{equation*}
%  T^{\mu\nu}_\mathrm{perfect} = A u^\mu u^\nu + B g^{\mu\nu}\,.
%\end{equation*}
%%
%$A,B$ may be physically interpreted by specialising the above
%equation to a fluid at rest, $u^\mu = (1,0,0,\ldots)$. In that case
%%
%\begin{equation*}
%  T^{\mu\nu}_\mathrm{perfect} =
%  \begin{pmatrix}
%    A-B & 0 & 0   \\
%    0   & B & 0   \\
%    0   & 0 & B   \\
%  \end{pmatrix}
%  =
%  \begin{pmatrix}
%    \rho & 0 & 0   \\
%    0    & P & 0   \\
%    0    & 0 & P   \\
%  \end{pmatrix}
%\end{equation*}
%%
%allowing us to identify $B$ with the fluid pressure and $A-B$ with
%its density. Thus

The most general ultralocal stress tensor one can build out of the
fluid velocity and thermodynamic quantities that reduces to what is
expected for a fluid at rest is
\cite[ch.22]{Misner+ThorneETAL-Grav:73}
%
\begin{equation}\label{blkstr:eq}
  T^{\mu\nu}_\mathrm{perfect} = (\rho+P) u^\mu u^\nu + P g^{\mu\nu}\,.
\end{equation}
%


\subsection{Dissipative part}\label{sec:visc}

Realistic fluids have a dissipative component to their stress tensor
in addition to the perfect fluid piece. In the long wavelength
limit, this stress tensor is a function of  the acceleration,
expansion, projection, and shear tensors (see e.g. \cite[Exercise
22.6-7]{Misner+ThorneETAL-Grav:73} and references therein),
%Realistic fluids

%tensor is a function of  the acceleration, expansion, projection,
%shear and rotation tensors (see e.g. \cite[Exercise
%22.6-7]{Misner+ThorneETAL-Grav:73}),
%
\begin{equation}\label{fluidtensors:eq}
\begin{split}
  a^\mu &= u^\nu \nabla_\nu u^\mu, \\
  \theta &= \nabla_\mu u^\mu, \\
  P^{\mu\nu} &= g^{\mu\nu} + u^\nu u^\mu, \\
  \sigma^{\mu\nu} &= \half \prn{P^{\mu\lambda} \nabla_\lambda u^\nu
                   + P^{\nu\lambda} \nabla_\lambda u^\mu}
                   - \frac{1}{d-1} \theta P^{\mu\nu}.%, \\
%  \omega^{\mu\nu} &= \half \prn{P^{\mu\lambda} \nabla_\lambda u^\nu
%                   - P^{\nu\lambda} \nabla_\lambda u^\mu}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
%
In terms of these quantities and the heat flow vector $q^\mu$ (see
immediately below)
%
\begin{equation}\label{extraTvisc:eq}
  T^{\mu\nu}_\mathrm{dissipative} = -\zeta \theta P^{\mu\nu} -
  2\eta\sigma^{\mu\nu} + q^\mu u^\nu + u^\mu q^\nu\,,
\end{equation}
%
where $\zeta$ is the bulk viscosity, $\eta$ is the shear viscosity.
The heat flux vector,
%
\begin{equation}\label{heatcond:eq}
  q^\mu = -\kappa P^{\mu\nu} (\p_\nu\tloc + a_\nu\tloc)\,.
\end{equation}
%
is the  relativistic generalisation of $\vec{q} = -\kappa
\vec{\nabla} \tloc$ (here $\kappa$ is the thermal conductivity); the
extra term in \eqref{heatcond:eq} is related to the inertia of
flowing heat.




\subsection{Surface contribution}\label{sec:srfstr}

We will use a simple model of surface tension where the energy
stored in the surface and the force per unit length are both given
by $\sigma$, which we take to be the surface tension at the critical
temperature computed in \cite{Aharony:2005bm}. We will ignore any
dependance $\sigma$ could have on the fluid temperature. This
approximation is valid when the fluid temperature at the surface
does not deviate substantially from $\tc$.

Consider a localised lump of fluid whose surface in space is given
by the equation $f(x)=0$. The surface contribution to the stress
tensor will be proportional to $\sigma\delta(f)$. In the long
wavelength limit it will only depend on the first derivatives of
$f$. The most general stress tensor we can build is
%
\begin{equation*}
  T^{\mu\nu}_\mathrm{surface} = \brk{\alpha\, \p^\mu\! f\, \p^\nu\! f
                   +\beta\, u^\mu u^\nu
                   +\gamma\, (u^\mu\p^\nu\! f + \p^\mu\! fu^\nu)
                   +\delta\, g^{\mu\nu}}\sigma\delta(f)\,.
\end{equation*}
%
As $u^2=-1$ and $u^\mu\p_\mu f = 0$ (the surface moves with the
fluid), the only invariant quantity that
$\alpha,\beta,\gamma,\delta$ can depend on is $(\p^\mu\! f\, \p_\mu
f)$. We can fix this dependence by demanding invariance under
reparameterisations of the surface\footnote{However, we should
choose a parametrisation such that $\p_\mu f$ is well behaved at the
surface, e.g.\ $f=x$, but not $f=x^2$ or $f=\sqrt{x}$.} (e.g.
$f(x)\ra g(x)f(x)$, so that $\p f\ra g\p f + f\p g = g\p f$ at the
surface). Defining $f_\mu = \frac{\p_\mu f}{\sqrt{\p f\cdt\p f}}$:
%
\begin{equation*}
    T^{\mu\nu}_\mathrm{surface} = \brk{A f^\mu f^\nu
                   +B u^\mu u^\nu
                   +C \prn{u^\mu f^\nu + f^\mu u^\nu}
                   +D g^{\mu\nu}}\sigma\sqrt{\p f\cdt\p f}\delta(f)\,.
\end{equation*}
%
We can fix $A,B,C,D$ by looking at a fluid at rest, $u^\mu =
(1,0,0,\ldots)$, with a surface $f(x)=x$
%
\begin{equation*}
  T^{\mu\nu}_\mathrm{surface} =
  \begin{pmatrix}
    B-D & C   & 0  \\
    C   & A+D & 0  \\
    0   & 0   & D  \\
  \end{pmatrix}
     \sigma\delta(x)=
  \begin{pmatrix}
    1 & 0 &  0   \\
    0 & 0 &  0   \\
    0 & 0 & -1   \\
  \end{pmatrix}
     \sigma\delta(x).
\end{equation*}
%
This gives
%
\begin{equation}\label{srfStr:eq}
  T^{\mu\nu}_\mathrm{surface} = \sigma\brk{f^\mu f^\nu - g^{\mu\nu}}
               \sqrt{\p f\cdt\p f}\delta(f)\,.
\end{equation}
%




\section{Rigidly rotating configurations}\label{sec:eqmot}

In this section, we study stationary, axially symmetric rotating
fluid configurations, whose equation of state is  presented in
various forms in appendix \ref{app:eqstate}. We choose the axis of
rotation as our origin in polar coordinates; in these coordinates
the fluid density is a function only of the radial coordinate $r$,
and the $(t,r,\phi)$ components of the velocity are given by $u^\mu
= \gamma(1,0,\omega)$ with $\gamma=\prn{1-\omega^2r^2}^{-1/2}$.  We
will find two distinct kinds of solutions; rotating plasmaballs with
the topology of a two dimensional disk, and plasmarings with the
topology of a two dimensional annulus. The configurations we find
are exact solutions to the equations of relativistic fluid dynamics;
in \S\S\ref{sec:validity} we will demonstrate that these equations
accurately represent plasma dynamics for large enough plasmaballs
and plasmarings.

\subsection{Equations of motion}

Our fluid propagates in flat 2+1 dimensional space. In polar
coordinates
%
\begin{equation}\label{metric:eq}
  \dr s^2 = -\dr t^2 + \dr r^2 + r^2 \dr \phi^2\,.
\end{equation}
%
This gives the following non-zero Christoffel symbols:
%
\begin{equation}\label{chrst:eq}
  \Gamma^r_{\phi\phi} = -r \qquad
  \Gamma^\phi_{r\phi} = \Gamma^\phi_{\phi r} =
  \frac{1}{r}\,.
\end{equation}
%

For the  stationary, axially symmetric configurations under
consideration, $\p_t T^{\mu \nu}= \p_\phi T^{\mu \nu} = 0$. Using
\eqref{chrst:eq}, \eqref{Epconsv:eq} becomes
%
\begin{align}\label{tEpconsv:eq}
    0 &= \nabla_\mu T^{\mu t}
       = \p_r T^{rt} + \frac{1}{r}T^{rt}, \\ \label{rEpconsv:eq}
    0 &= \nabla_\mu T^{\mu r}
       = \p_r T^{rr} + \frac{1}{r}T^{rr} - r T^{\phi\phi}, \\ \label{fEpconsv:eq}
    0 &= \nabla_\mu T^{\mu \phi}
       = \p_r T^{r\phi} + \frac{3}{r}T^{r\phi}.
\end{align}
%

The boundaries are $f_n = r-r_n$, with $n$ labelling the different
boundaries (outer for the disk, outer and inner for the annulus).
The `perfect fluid part' of the stress tensor is
%
\begin{equation}\label{blkstrour:eq}
  T^{\mu\nu}_\mathrm{perfect} =
   \begin{pmatrix}
     \gamma^2(\rho+\omega^2r^2P) & 0 & \gamma^2\omega(\rho+P) \\
     0                           & P & 0 \\
     \gamma^2\omega(\rho+P)      & 0 & \frac{\gamma^2}{r^2}(\omega^2r^2\rho+P) \\
   \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
%
and the surface stress tensor
%
\begin{equation}\label{srfstrour:eq}
  T^{\mu\nu}_\mathrm{surface} =
    \sigma \sum_n \delta(r-r_n)
  \begin{pmatrix}
    1 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & -\frac{1}{r^2} \\
  \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
%
For the dissipative part of the stress tensor, we find
$\theta=\sigma^{\mu\nu}=0$ and
%
%\begin{equation}\label{ourfluidtensors:eq}
%\begin{split}
%  a_\mu &= (0,-\gamma^2\omega^2r,0)\,, \\
%  P^{\mu\nu} &= \begin{pmatrix}
%                  \gamma^2\omega^2r^2 & 0 & \gamma^2\omega \\
%                  0                   & 1 & 0 \\
%                  \gamma^2\omega      & 0 & \frac{\gamma^2}{r^2} \\
%                \end{pmatrix},\\
%  \omega_{\mu\nu} &= \gamma^3\omega r \begin{pmatrix}
%                                        0       & \omega & 0 \\
%                                        -\omega & 0      & 1 \\
%                                        0       & 1      & 0 \\
%                                      \end{pmatrix}.
%\end{split}
%\end{equation}
%%
%We also find
%
\begin{equation}\label{ourheatcond:eq}
  \p_\nu\tloc + a_\nu\tloc = \prn{0, \gamma
  \diff{}{r}\brk{\frac{\tloc}{\gamma}},0}\,,
\end{equation}
%
so that
%
\begin{equation}\label{dissT:eq}
  T^{\mu\nu}_\mathrm{dissipative} =
   -\kappa\gamma^2\diff{}{r}\brk{\frac{\tloc}{\gamma}}
   \begin{pmatrix}
     0 & 1      & 0      \\
     1 & 0      & \omega \\
     0 & \omega & 0      \\
   \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
%

We will now write the equations of motion $\nabla_\mu T^{\mu \nu}=0$
temporarily ignoring the contribution from  this heat flow,
$T^{\mu\nu}_\mathrm{dissipative}$; it will turn out (we see this
immediately below) that $T^{\mu\nu}_\mathrm{dissipative}$ actually
vanishes on our solutions, justifying this procedure.

The only non-trivial equation of motion, \eqref{rEpconsv:eq}, can be
written as
%
\begin{equation}\label{eom:eq}
  \diff{P}{r} = \frac{\omega^2r}{1-\omega^2r^2}\,(\rho+P)
              - \sum_n \frac{\sigma}{r}\, \delta(r-r_n)\,.
\end{equation}
%
For these fluids (with no chemical potentials for any conserved
charges), $P=-f$ is a function only of $\tloc$, so $P+\rho = s\tloc$
and $\diff{P}{\tloc} = s$. So, away from the boundaries,
\eqref{eom:eq} becomes
%
\begin{equation}\label{tempr:eq}
\begin{split}
  s \diff{\tloc}{r} &= s \tloc \diff{\ln\gamma}{r} \\ \implies
  \diff{}{r}\brk{\frac{\tloc}{\gamma}} &= 0
\end{split}
\end{equation}
%
It follows that $T^{\mu \nu}_\mathrm{dissipative}$  vanishes for
rigid rotation, justifying our neglect of heat flow.

Our discussion has not assumed a specific form of the equation of
state. Using this particular equation of state of our plasma
\eqref{therm3d:eq}, we can rewrite \eqref{tempr:eq} in the fluid
interior as
%
\begin{equation}\label{eombulk:eq}
  \prn{\rho(r)-\rz}\prn{1-\omega^2r^2}^2 = \text{constant}.
\end{equation}
%
Integrating \eqref{eom:eq} across a surface gives
%
\begin{equation}\label{bcndgen:eq}
  P_>-P_< = -\frac{\sigma}{r}\,.
\end{equation}
%
where $P_>$ and $P_<$ are the pressures at infinitesimally greater
and smaller radii than the location of the surface.



\subsection{Spinning ball}\label{sec:ballsol}

Let us first study a fluid configuration with a single outer surface
at $r=\ro$ with $P_>=0$. Using the equation of state
\eqref{therm3d:eq}, the boundary condition \eqref{bcndgen:eq} can be
written as
%
\begin{equation}\label{bcout:eq}
  \rho(\ro) = 4\rz + \frac{3\sigma}{\ro}\,.
\end{equation}
%

If we define dimensionless variables
%
\begin{equation}\label{newvars:eq}
    \tw = \frac{\sigma\omega}{\rz} \,,   \qquad
    \z = \frac{\rz r}{\sigma} \,,   \qquad
    v = \omega r = \tw \z \,,
\end{equation}
%
then \eqref{eombulk:eq} can be written as
%
\begin{equation}\label{ballsol:eq}
  \prn{\frac{\rho(v)-\rz}{3\rz}}\prn{1-v^2}^{2}
       = \prn{1+\frac{\tw}{\vo}}\prn{1-\vo^2}^{2}
       \equiv g_+(\vo).
\end{equation}
%

Note that the range of $v$ is $[0,1]$ and $\rho(v)-\rz$ is always
positive for this solution, as is required for the last equation of
\eqref{therm3d:eq} to make sense.

We can also compute the local plasma temperature using
\eqref{therm3d:eq}
%
\begin{equation}\label{temploc:eq}
  \tloc = \gamma\prn{\frac{\rz g_+(\vo)}{\lambda}}^{1/4}.
\end{equation}
%

\subsection{Spinning ring}\label{sec:ringsol}

We now turn to solutions that have an inner surface well an outer
surface. In addition to the boundary condition at the outer radius
\eqref{bcout:eq} we now have
%
\begin{equation}\label{bcin:eq}
  \rho(\ri) = 4\rz - \frac{3\sigma}{\ri}\,.
\end{equation}
%


So the full solution is
%
\begin{equation}\label{ringsol:eq}
 \begin{split}
  \prn{\frac{\rho(v)-\rz}{3\rz}}\prn{1-v^2}^{2}
       = \prn{1+\frac{\tw}{\vo}}\prn{1-\vo^2}^{2}
       &\equiv g_+(\vo)\\
       = \prn{1-\frac{\tw}{\vi}}\prn{1-\vi^2}^{2}
       &\equiv g_-(\vi).
 \end{split}
\end{equation}
%

Note that $\rho(v)-\rz\geq 0$ provided that $\vi \geq \tw$.

%The relation between $\vo$ and $\vi$ can be written as
%%
%\begin{equation}\label{vovi:eq}
%  \begin{split}
%    0 =&\, U(\vo,\vi,\tw)
%         \equiv \frac{\vo\vi}{\vo+\vi}(g_+(\vo)-g_-(\vi)) \\
%      =&\, \tw - 2 \tw \vi \vo + 2 \vi^2 \vo + \tw \vi^3 \vo - \vi^4 \vo -
%    2 \vi \vo^2 - \tw \vi^2 \vo^2 + \vi^3 \vo^2 \\ &+ \tw \vi \vo^3 -
%    \vi^2 \vo^3 + \vi \vo^4.
%  \end{split}
%\end{equation}
%%
%This can be used to eliminate $\tw$ using
%%
%\begin{equation}\label{aelim:eq}
%  \tw = \frac{ \vo  \vi (\vo - \vi)(2 - \vo^2 - \vi^2)}
%  {1 - \vo \vi (2 - \vo^2 + \vo \vi - \vi^2)}\,,
%\end{equation}
%%
%however, this can make the distinction between different solutions
%difficult to see. We could also use \eqref{vovi:eq} to eliminate
%$\vo$ or $\vi$. The expressions for these two are too complicated to
%write here.

Again, we can compute the local plasma temperature using
\eqref{therm3d:eq}
%
\begin{equation}\label{temploc2:eq}
  \tloc = \gamma\prn{\frac{\rz g_+(\vo)}{\lambda}}^{1/4}
        = \gamma\prn{\frac{\rz g_-(\vi)}{\lambda}}^{1/4}.
\end{equation}
%

  \caption{Graph of $g_\pm(v)$ showing possible values of $v_{o,i}$}\label{gpm:fig}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

%As shown in fig.\ref{gpm:fig}, we define $\vi^*$ to be the maximum
%of $g_-$:
%%
%\begin{equation}\label{vis:eq}
%  g_-'(\vi^*)=0\,.
%\end{equation}
%%
%Then we can also define $g^*$ and $\vo^*$ by
%%
%\begin{equation}\label{vos:eq}
%    g^* = g_-(\vi^*)\,, \qquad
%    g_+(\vo^*) = g^*\,.
%\end{equation}
%%
The two functions, $g_\pm(v)$ are schematically plotted in
fig.\ref{gpm:fig} for some value of $\tw$, where we have labelled
special velocities $\vi^*$ and $\vo^*$. As $\vi<1$, it is necessary
that $\tw<1$.

We can see that there are no solutions to $g_+(\vo)=g_-(\vi)$ for
$\vo<\vo^*$ and two solutions for $\vo>\vo^*$. One of these has
$\vi<\vi^*$ (the thick ring) and one has $\vi>\vi^*$ (the thin
ring). The distinction between `thin' and `thick' rings will not
prove physically important. In \S\S\ref{sec:exist} we will find it
physically useful to distinguish between distinct ring solutions (we
will call these large and small rings) at the same values of
conserved charges (energy and angular momentum), rather than the
parameters $\vo$ and $\tw$.






\section{Thermodynamic Potentials}\label{sec:charges}

In this section, we compute the thermodynamic potentials (energy,
angular momentum, entropy, etc.) for the spinning plasmaball and
plasmarings themselves, rather than their constituent plasma. This
includes contributions from the kinetic energy of the plasma as well
as its internal energy.

The constitutive relations we find  are predictions for, e.g.,
entropy as a function of mass and angular momentum of the dual
gravity solutions.

\subsection{Densities}\label{sec:chdens}

In this subsection we list formulae for energy density, angular
momentum density and entropy density. In the next subsection we will
integrate these expressions to find explicit formulae for the
energy, angular momentum and entropy of spinning plasmaballs and
plasmarings.

The energy density is given by
%
\begin{equation}\label{Edens:eq}
\begin{split}
  T^{tt} &= \gamma^2 \prn{\rho+\omega^2r^2P}
              + \sum_n \sigma\, \delta(r-r_n) \\
     &= \rz \brk{1+g_+(\vo)\frac{3+v^2}{\prn{1-v^2}^{3}}
                + \sum_n 2\tw v \,\delta(v^2-v^2_n)}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
%

The angular momentum density is given by
%
\begin{equation}\label{Ldens:eq}
  r^2 T^{t\phi} = \gamma^2\omega r^2 (\rho+P) =
    4\sigma\frac{g_+(\vo)}{\tw}\frac{v^2}{\prn{1-v^2}^{3}}\,.
\end{equation}
%


The entropy density is given by
%
\begin{equation}\label{Sdens:eq}
  \gamma s =
  \frac{4\lambda^{1/4}}{3^{3/4}}\frac{(\rho-\rz)^{3/4}}{\sqrt{1-v^2}} =
  4(\lambda\rz^3)^{1/4}\frac{g_+(\vo)^{3/4}}{(1-v^2)^{2}}
\end{equation}
%

\subsection{Integrals}\label{sec:ints}
%
%The integration measure is
%%
%\begin{equation*}
%  \int r\dr r \dr\phi = \frac{\pi\sigma^2}{\rz^2\tw^2}
%                          \int \dr (v^2)
%\end{equation*}
%%

We can define some dimensionless variables
%
\begin{equation}\label{redch:eq}
  \tE = \frac{\rz E}{\pi\sigma^2} \,,\quad
  \tL = \frac{\rz^2 L}{\pi\sigma^3} \,,\quad
  \tS = \frac{\rz^{5/4}S}{\pi\lambda^{1/4}\sigma^2} \,,\quad
  \tT = T\prn{\frac{\lambda}{\rz}}^{1/4},\quad
  \tO = \frac{\sigma\Omega}{\rz}\,.
\end{equation}
%
The last of these ensure that $\tT = \pdiffc[\tL]{\tE}{\tS}$ and
$\tO = \pdiffc[\tS]{\tE}{\tL}$ follow from $T = \pdiffc[L]{E}{S}$
and $\Omega = \pdiffc[S]{E}{L}$


\subsubsection{Spinning ball}\label{sec:ballch}

Energy
%
\begin{equation}\label{ballE:eq}
  \tE = \frac{4\vo^2-\vo^4+5\tw \vo-\tw \vo^3}{\tw^2}
%    = (4\zo^2+3\zo) - \tw^2 (\zo^4+\zo^3)\,.
\end{equation}
%
Angular momentum
%
\begin{equation}\label{ballL:eq}
  \tL = \frac{2\vo^4+2\tw \vo^3}{\tw^3}
%    = 2\tw (\zo^4+\zo^3)\,.
\end{equation}
%
Entropy
%
\begin{equation}\label{ballS:eq}
  \tS = \frac{4\vo^2}{\tw^2}\sqrt{1-\vo^2}
         \prn{1+\frac{\tw}{\vo}}^{3/4}
%    = 4\zo^2\sqrt{1-\tw^2\zo^2}
%         \prn{1+\frac{1}{\zo}}^{3/4}.
\end{equation}
%

\subsubsection{Spinning ring}\label{sec:ringch}

Energy
%
\begin{equation}\label{ringE:eq}
\begin{split}
    \tE &= \frac{4(\vo^2-\vi^2) - (\vo^4-\vi^4)
                 + 5\tw (\vo+\vi) - \tw (\vo^3+\vi^3)}
             {\tw^2}
%    \\
%    &= \brk{4(\zo^2-\zi^2) + 5(\zo+\zi)}
%     - \tw^2 \brk{(\zo^4-\zi^4) + (\zo^3+\zi^3)}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
%
Angular momentum
%
\begin{equation}\label{ringL:eq}
\begin{split}
  \tL &= \frac{2(\vo^4-\vi^4)+2\tw (\vo^3+\vi^3)}{\tw^3}
%  \\
%    &= 2\tw\brk{(\zo^4-\zi^4) + (\zo^3+\zi^3)}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
%
Entropy
%
\begin{equation}\label{ringS:eq}
\begin{split}
  \tS &= \frac{4}{\tw^2}
        \brk{\sqrt{1-\vo^2}\prn{1+\frac{\tw}{\vo}}^{3/4}
            -\sqrt{1-\vi^2}\prn{1-\frac{\tw}{\vi}}^{3/4}}
%   \\
%    &= \frac{4}{\tw^2}
%       \brk{\sqrt{1-\tw^2\zo^2}\prn{1+\frac{1}{\zo}}^{3/4}
%            -\sqrt{1-\tw^2\zi^2}\prn{1-\frac{1}{\zi}}^{3/4}}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
%


\subsection{Temperature and angular velocity}\label{sec:temp}

In this subsection we determine the temperature and angular velocity
of spinning plasmaballs and plasmarings using
%
\begin{equation}\label{tempdef:eq}
  \tT = \pdiffc[\tL]{\tE}{\tS}, \qquad   \tO = \pdiffc[\tS]{\tE}{\tL}.
\end{equation}


%
Note that the temperature defined above is different from the local
plasma temperature, $\tloc$ (which varies across our solutions), in
(\ref{therm:eq}-\ref{therm3d:eq}); the angular velocity defined
above will turn out to be $\omega$ on all our solutions, although it
is apparently a priori different.

It may be verified that the temperature and angular velocity of
plasmaballs is given by
%
\begin{equation}\label{temp:eq}
  \tT = [g_+(\vo)]^{1/4}, \qquad \tO = \tw\,.
\end{equation}
%
The corresponding expressions  for the rings are identical
%
\begin{equation}\label{temp2:eq}
  \tT = [g_+(\vo)]^{1/4} = [g_-(\vi)]^{1/4}, \qquad \tO = \tw\,.
\end{equation}
%

Thus, local temperatures, $\tc$, and angular velocities, $\omega$,
for both the ball and the ring, are given simply in terms of $T$ and
$\Omega$
%
\begin{equation*}
  \tloc = \frac{T}{\sqrt{1-v^2}}\,, \qquad \omega=\Omega\,.
\end{equation*}
%


\section{Solutions at fixed energy and angular
momentum}\label{sec:enang}

\subsection{Existence}\label{sec:exist}

  \caption{Scatter plots of energy and angular momentum of (a)
spinning balls and (b) rings.}\label{exist_scat:fig}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

In fig.\ref{exist_scat:fig}, we display scatter plots for the energy
and angular momentum of ball and ring solutions over the full range
of solution parameters.\footnote{In order to generate these plots
for the ball, a range of vales of $(\vo,\tw)$ were chosen and
$(E,L)$ were computed using (\ref{ballE:eq},\ref{ballL:eq}). For the
ring, a range of vales of $(\vi,\tw)$ were chosen, $\vo$ was
computed using \eqref{ringsol:eq}, and $(E,L)$ were computed using
(\ref{ringE:eq},\ref{ringL:eq}).} The various regions of existence
of the plasmaball, thin plasmaring and thick plasmaring in the $E-L$
plane are drawn schematically in fig.\ref{exist_prelim:fig}.

\begin{figure}
%
 \begin{center}
 \small{O - no solutions, A - 1 ring, B - 2 rings, C - 1 ball.}\\
  (a)%\includegraphics[width=4cm]{ballreg.eps}
  \input{ballreg.tpx}
  \hspace{2.5cm}
  (b)%\includegraphics[width=4cm]{ringreg.eps}
  \input{ringreg.tpx}
 \caption{Regions where (a) ball and (b) ring solutions
exist.}\label{exist_prelim:fig}
 \end{center}
\end{figure}


The ball solution exists over a region C in the $E-L$ plane. At the
boundary of the region C the ball solution $\vo$ attains its maximum
value of unity. Using (\ref{ballE:eq},\ref{ballL:eq}) we find an
analytic expression for the boundary of C:
%
\begin{equation}\label{ballexist:eq}
  \tL = \frac{2}{27}\brk{(3\tE+4)^{3/2}-9\tE-8}
     \sim \frac{2\tE^{3/2}}{3^{3/2}}
     \quad\text{for large }\tE\,.
\end{equation}
%
From \eqref{temp:eq}, we see that balls on this boundary saturate
the extremality bound (i.e.\ have zero temperature).

Like the balls, rings of a fixed energy have a maximum value of
angular momentum. Rings at the edge of this bound (the boundary
between O and A in fig.\ref{exist_prelim:fig}b) have $\vo=\vi=1$ and
so are extremal (see \eqref{temp2:eq}) and of zero width. Using
(\ref{ringE:eq},\ref{ringL:eq}) the O-A boundary is given by
%
\begin{equation}\label{thinexist:eq}
  \tL = \frac{\tE^2}{16}\,,
\end{equation}
%
(this expression is valid only for $\tE>8$, $\tL>2$; at lower
energies $\tw$ exceeds unity).

As we lower angular momentum of the solution, this ring moves away
from extremality and increases in width. At a particular angular
momentum (the boundary between region A and region B) a new ring
solution comes into existence. The corresponding solution has
$\vo=1$, $\vi=\tw$ and so is extremal (see \eqref{temp2:eq}. Using
(\ref{ringE:eq},\ref{ringL:eq}), the analytic expression for the A-B
boundary is given by
%
\begin{equation}\label{thickexist:eq}
  \tL = \frac{2}{27}\brk{(3\tE+1)^{3/2}-9\tE+1}
     \sim \frac{2\tE^{3/2}}{3^{3/2}}
     \quad\text{for large }\tE\,,
\end{equation}
%
(for $\tE>8$, $\tL>2$ as above). In the high energy limit  $\tE \gg
1$ the ratio of angular momentum for the new extremal rings (at the
A-B boundary) and extremal plasmaball tends to unity, (even though
the the difference between angular momenta does not go to zero).
Consequently the leading high energy behaviour of
\eqref{thickexist:eq} and \eqref{ballexist:eq} is the same in this
limit,  as is also clear from fig.\ref{exist_final:fig}. We
emphasise that, for our solutions, the extremal ball and extremal
thick ring are not quite identical (as is the case for black holes
and small black rings \cite{Emparan:2001wn} in flat space) as the
inner radius of our extremal thick rings does not vanish. However,
the inner radius of the extremal thick ring is always (for all
values of energy) of the same order as the thickness of the domain
wall. As the fluid dynamics approximations fail precisely under
these conditions, it could well be that the new extremal plasmaring
and extremal plasmaball are actually identical configurations.

As we further lower angular momentum, the new ring solution moves
away from extremality; this new solution always has a smaller outer
radius than the `original' ring solution (the solutions that also
exists in region A), as shown in fig.\ref{outer:fig}. As a
consequence, we refer to these two ring solutions as small and large
respectively.

\begin{figure}
%
 \begin{center}
  %\small{ Red - thin ring, Blue - thick ring.} \\
   %\includegraphics[width=6cm]{outer.eps}
   \input{outer.tpx}
 \caption{Outer radius of large and small rings as a function of
angular momentum, $\tL$, at fixed energy,
$\tE=40$.}\label{outer:fig}
 \end{center}
\end{figure}


Further lowering angular momentum, we hit the boundary between
regions B and O where the two ring solutions merge into each other.
At still lower angular momentum, we have no ring solutions. The C-O
boundary may thus be obtained by minimising $\tL$ at fixed $\tE$. If
one uses \eqref{ringsol:eq} to eliminate $\tw$, this amounts to
%
\begin{equation*}
  \pdiffc[\vi]{\tE}{\vo}\pdiffc[\vo]{\tL}{\vi}
  -\pdiffc[\vo]{\tE}{\vi}\pdiffc[\vi]{\tL}{\vo}
    =0.
\end{equation*}
%

The existence of plasmaball and plasmaring solutions in the E-L
plane may thus be summarised as in fig.\ref{exist_final:fig}.




%We have so far differentiated between `thin' and `thick' ring
%solutions based on the $(\vo,\tw)$ parameterisation. While this
%distinction was useful for the formal purposes, we now see that
%there exists a more physical distinction between ring solutions.
%While a single thin ring exists in the region A of
%fig.\ref{exist_prelim:fig}, two ring solutions exist in regions B
%and C. Let us denote the union of the regions B and C by $\tB$. In
%the rest of this paper we will refer to the ring in region A, and
%the ring with larger outer radius in $\tB$ as the \emph{large ring}.
%The smaller ring in $\tB$ will be called the \emph{small ring}. Note
%that small rings are always thick, while large rings could be either
%thin (regions A and B) or thick (region C) - however the distinction
%between thin and thick large rings is physically unimportant; we
%will not find it necessary to distinguish between the regions B and
%C in the rest of this paper. The existence of plasmaball and
%plasmaring solutions in the E-L plane may thus be summarised as in
%fig.\ref{exist_final:fig}.

\subsection{Validity}\label{sec:validity}

As we have described above,  plasmaballs and plasmarings are exact
solutions to the relativistic Navier-Stokes equations (supplemented
by sharp surface boundary conditions). However these equations of
fluid dynamics accurately capture the dynamics of the fluid plasma
only under certain conditions. In our discussion we have assigned a
well defined pressure and temperature to the fluid at each point in
space. Clearly this procedure is valid only when the variation of
these thermodynamic quantities is small over the length scale of the
mean free path of the quasiparticles (roughly gluons) of our system.
The mean free path is of the same order as the mass gap of the
theory, which in turn is similar to the deconfinement
temperature.\footnote{It was argued in \cite{Aharony:2005bm} that
the mean free path does not scale with $N$. According to
quasiparticle kinetic theory, the mean free path is approximately
the ratio of the shear viscosity and the energy density. The
computations reviewed in \cite{Son:2007vk} show that this quantity
is of order $1/\tc$ in the limit of the 't~Hooft coupling
$\lambda\ra\infty$.}

Second, we have treated the surface of the plasma as sharp; in
reality this surface has a thickness of order $\tc^{-1}$.
Consequently, our treatment of the surface is valid only when its
deviation from a straight line occurs on scales large compared to
$\tc^{-1}$ (higher derivative contributions to the surface stress
tensor, which we have ignored in our treatment, would become
important if this were not the case); further we must also require
that only a small fraction of the fluid should reside in surfaces.

Thirdly, we have ignored the fact that the surface tension is a
function of the fluid temperature at the surface, and simply set
$\sigma=\sigma(\tc)$. This is valid provided that $\tloc/\tc \approx
1$ at all surfaces.

Finally, the fluid evolution equations, by their very nature, track mean
velocities and energy densities, ignoring fluctuations. In our context this
approximation is justified by large $N$; fluctuations are suppressed by powers of $1/N^2$,
dual to the suppression of quantum metric fluctuations in the bulk.

Recall that
%
\begin{equation*}
  \rz \sim N^2\tc^3, \qquad \sigma \sim  N^2\tc^2,
  \qquad \text{so}\quad \frac{1}{\tc} \sim \frac{\sigma}{\rz}
\end{equation*}
%
(for the domain wall solution of \cite{Aharony:2005bm},
$\frac{\sigma}{\rz}=2.0\times \frac{4}{\tc}$ and the thickness is
$6\times \frac{1}{2\pi \tc}$).

As an estimate of the scale over which thermodynamic quantities
vary, we compute the fractional change in the fluid temperature over
the distance of a mean free path. As the temperature is proportional
to $\gamma$, we should look at
%
\begin{equation*}
  \frac{1}{\tc}\diff{}{r}\ln\gamma \sim
   \frac{\sigma}{\rz} \frac{\omega^2 r}{1-\omega^2r^2} =
   \frac{\tw v}{1-v^2}\,.
\end{equation*}
%
As this takes its maximum value at the outer surface, the condition
for the validity of the equations of fluid dynamics  may be
estimated to be
%
\begin{equation}\label{validity2:eq}
  \Delta u \equiv \frac{\tw \vo}{1-\vo^2} \ll 1\,.
\end{equation}
%

Our treatment of the surface as a zero-thickness object is valid if
%
\begin{equation*}
  \{\ro,\ri,\ro-\ri\} \gg \frac{1}{\tc} \sim
  \frac{\sigma}{\rz}
\end{equation*}
%
(for the ring, the $\ro$ inequality in the equation above follows
automatically from the either of the other two inequalities). This
condition can be rewritten in terms of our dimensionless variables
as
%
\begin{equation}\label{validity:eq}
\begin{aligned}
  \vo &\gg \tw
      &\quad&\text{or}\quad&
   \zo &\gg 1
      &\quad \text{for the ball,}\\
  \{\vi,\vo-\vi\} &\gg \tw
      &\quad&\text{or}\quad&
   \{\zi,\zo-\zi\} &\gg 1
      &\quad \text{for the ring.}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
%




In fig.\ref{validity:fig}, we have plotted $\ln(1/\Delta u)$,
$\ln(\zi)$, $\ln(\zo-\zi)$ and $\ln(\zo)$ for the thin ring, thick
ring and ball. From the figure we observe that these quantities are
large (and so the fluid dynamics approximations of this paper are
accurate) when our rings and balls have large energy and we stay
away from the extremality bounds.

$\ln(\tloc_{max}/\tc)$ for i) balls, ii) small rings, iii) large

\end{figure}

Finally,  validity of our approximation of the surface tension as
a constant (independent of temperature) requires that the maximum
and minimum values of $\ln(\tloc/\tc)$ (which occur at the outer and
inner surfaces respectively) are both small. We have plotted these
quantities in fig.\ref{linvalidity:fig}. It is clear from these
figures that this condition is fulfilled for large energy and
angular momentum provided that we are not near extremality.




\subsection{Global stability and phase diagram}\label{sec:globstab}

Recall that (see fig.\ref{exist_final:fig}) at fixed values of
energy and angular momentum, we have either 0, 1 or 3 plasmaball /
plasmaring solutions. At those values of charges for which multiple
solutions exist, it is natural to inquire which of these solutions
is entropically favoured. In fig.\ref{ent:fig} we have plotted the
entropy of plasma ball and plasmaring solutions as a function of
angular momentum at fixed energy.

Note that, when it exists, the small ring always carries lower
entropy than both the big ring and the plasmaball. At low enough
angular momentum the plasmaball is the only solution. This solution
continues to be entropically dominant (upon raising the angular
momentum) over an interval, even after the new ring solutions are
nucleated. At a critical angular momentum, however, the entropy of
the large ring equals and then exceeds the entropy of the plasmaball
(all three ring solutions continue to exist in a neighbourhood about
this point). The large ring is the entropically dominant solution at
all larger angular momenta.

\subsection{Comparison with black rings in flat 5D space}\label{sec:existcomp}

As we have explained in the introduction, the plasmaball and
plasmaring solutions of this paper are dual to black holes and black
rings in the background \eqref{deconfmet:eq}. Unfortunately the
corresponding gravitational solutions have not yet been constructed;
however exact Black ring solutions to the vacuum Einstein equations
in 5 dimensions, were obtained in \cite{Emparan:2001wn} (see
\cite{Emparan:2006mm} for a review). These solutions were further
studied in \cite{Elvang:2006dd}. In this subsection we compare the
properties these black rings and black holes with our plasmaballs
and plasmarings, and find broad qualitative agreement between the
two. \footnote{While we expect the properties of plasmaballs and
plasmarings to match quantitatively with those of black holes and
black rings in the background \eqref{deconfmet:eq}, we could not
hope to find better than qualitative agreement with the properties
of the same objects in flat space.}

In fig.\ref{brphase:fig} we have presented a schematic plot for the
existence of black hole and black ring solutions in 5 dimensional
flat space. This figure looks fairly similar to
figs.\ref{exist_final:fig},\ref{phase:fig}. The major qualitative
difference is the absence of the analogue of the region O (see fig.
\ref{exist_final:fig}) in fig. \ref{brphase:fig}. Thus unlike thin
black rings in flat 5 dimensional space, plasmarings (and so black
rings in Scherk-Schwarz AdS$_5$) have an upper bound to their
angular momentum at fixed energy.

It is interesting to pursue the comparison between these solutions
in more detail. The gravitational analogue of fig.\ref{ent:fig}
(presented as \cite[fig.3]{Emparan:2001wn}) looks fairly similar to
our figure. The main qualitative differences are: unlike for
plasmarings, the entropy of the large flat space black ring doesn't
go to zero at a finite angular momentum (it asymptotes to zero at
infinity) and the entropy of the small flat space black ring and
black hole go to zero at exactly the same point instead of the
slightly different values that we see. We expect that first of these
differences reflects a physical difference between black rings in
flat space and Scherk-Schwarz compactified AdS$_5$, the second
difference is an artefact of the breakdown of the fluid dynamics
approximation for extremal small rings (whose inner radius is always
of order the mean free path).

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
  \small{A' - thin black ring, B' - thin black ring, thick black ring
  and black hole, C' - black hole.}\\
  \input{br.tpx}
  \caption{Existence regions and phase boundary for black holes /
rings.}\label{brphase:fig}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

In even greater detail, we could quantitatively compare the
boundaries between regions O, A, B and C (see
fig.\ref{exist_prelim:fig}). These curves, as well as the phase
boundary, may be parameterised by $L=xE^y$ at large energies.

For black holes and black rings in flat space
$y_{AB}=y_{OC}=y_{BO}=y_{phase}=\frac{3}{2}$. For our plasmaballs
and plasmarings, as one can see in fig.\ref{logboundary:fig} (or
from (\ref{ballexist:eq}-\ref{thickexist:eq}) for the first three),
for large energy, we get $y_{OA}=2$, $y_{AB}=y_{OC}=\frac{3}{2}$,
$y_{BO}=1.25$ and $y_{phase}=1.25$ (see table \ref{bndscale:tab}).

It is meaningless to compare the $x$'s directly, as they are
dimensionful quantities. However, when two $y$'s have the same
value, the ratio of the corresponding $x$'s is dimensionless and may
be compared. For black rings $x_{AB}=\sqrt{32G/27\pi}$,
$x_{BO}=\sqrt{G/\pi}$ and $x_{phase}=\sqrt{256G/243\pi}$, so
$x_{AB}/x_{OC}=1$, $x_{OC}/x_{BO}=\sqrt{32/27}$ and
$x_{BO}/x_{phase}=9\sqrt{3}/16$. For plasmaballs and plasmarings, if
we used the dimensionless quantities \eqref{redch:eq}, we find
$x_{OA}=\frac{1}{16}$, $x_{AB}=x_{OC}=2/3^{3/2}$, $x_{BO}\approx
0.60$ and $x_{phase}\approx 0.67$. Therefore $x_{AB}/x_{OC}=1$ and
$x_{BO}/x_{phase}\approx 0.91$.

This is summarised in table \ref{bndscale:tab}. Note that the
extremality boundaries, OA, AB and OC, occur precisely where at
least one of the approximations discussed in \S\S\ref{sec:validity}
breaks down. Therefore, nothing quantitative about these boundaries
should be trusted.

\subsection{Turning point stability}\label{sec:turn}

We have seen in \S\S\ref{sec:globstab} that the spinning plasma
solution of maximal entropy is the plasmaball (at low angular
momentum) or the large plasmaring (at high angular momentum). The
`phase transition' between these two solutions may be thought of as
being of first order (in the sense that the two competing solutions
are different at the phase transition point). The small plasmaring
is entropically subdominant to both the plasmaball and the large
plasmaring whenever it exists.

This situation appears to lend itself to a description in terms of a
Landau diagram, with the entropy given by a function of the
(unidentified) order parameter that has two maxima (the plasmaball
and the large plasmaring) separated by a single minimum (the small
plasmaring). This analogy suggests - and we conjecture that - the
small plasmaring is always dynamically unstable, while the
plasmaball and large plasmarings are dynamically stable with respect
to axisymmetric fluctuations.

An honest verification of our conjecture would require a study of
the spectrum of linear fluctuations about our plasmaball and
plasmaring solutions, an analysis that we have not carried out. In
this subsection, however, we present some evidence for our
conjecture, using the `turning point' stability analysis of
\cite{Poincare-lequdunemassflui:85} (see \cite{Arcioni:2004ww} for
discussion and references).

Consider a (not necessarily stable) equilibrium configuration that
changes from being stable to unstable under continuous variation.
The configurations we apply these considerations to are plasmarings;
according to our conjecture these rings are stable to axisymmetric
fluctuations when large but become unstable to the same modes when
small. At the boundary of stability, the matrix of second
derivatives of the entropy with respect to off shell variations (or
`order parameters') of the configuration under question develops a
zero eigenvalue. In the neighbourhood of this special point, a small
change in the thermodynamic potentials of the solution give rise to
a large change in the order parameter along the zero eigenvalue
direction (as such a change is entropically inexpensive). As argued
in \cite{1978MNRAS.183..765K, 1979MNRAS.189..817K, Sorkin:1981jc,
Sorkin:1982ut}, this results in a divergent contribution to the
second derivative of the equilibrium entropy as a function of
equilibrium thermodynamic quantities (for instance the angular
momentum at fixed energy) proportional to the negative inverse of
the small eigenvalue.

It follows that a configuration that changes stability has divergent
second derivatives of entropy with respect to - say - angular
momentum. Moreover the sign of this second derivative is positive in
the `more stable' phase and negative in the `less stable' phase.
Note that the turning point method gives information about the
change in the number of unstable directions about a solution, but
does not yield information about the absolute number of
instabilities.\footnote{Moreover, this method only links vertical
tangents - and not vertical asymptotes - in the graph of the first
derivative of entropy with respect to (say) angular momentum vs.\
angular momentum (a conjugacy diagram) to instabilities, as vertical
asymptotes occur at boundaries of equilibrium solution space instead
of separating solutions of differing degrees of stability.}

The turning point method is useful because it yields information
about stability properties, with respect to off shell fluctuations,
of phases, using information only about on shell variations. It is
especially useful in the study of nonextensive systems like black
holes, for which negative specific heats do not necessarily imply
dynamical instability. This method has been used to study the
stability of black rings in 5 dimensions \cite{Arcioni:2004ww,
Arcioni:2005fm}; it suggests that small black rings are always
unstable, while large black rings are more stable in that context.
This result corroborates the explicit linear fluctuation analysis
about the flat space black rings \cite{Elvang:2006dd}.
%(Note,
%however, there are some suggestions that this might only be
%sensitive to axisymmetric fluctuations).

We now proceed to apply the turning point method to our plasmarings.
Define
%
\begin{align}
\label{betadef:eq}
  \beta &= \pdiffc[\tL]{\tS}{\tE} = \frac{1}{\tT} =
  \frac{1}{[g_+(\vo,\tw)]^{1/4}}\,,\\
\label{psidef:eq}
  \psi &= \pdiffc[\tE]{\tS}{\tL} = -\frac{\tO}{\tT} =
  -\frac{\tw}{[g_+(\vo,\tw)]^{1/4}}\,.
\end{align}
%

In fig.\ref{turn:fig} we have plotted $\psi$ against angular
momentum at fixed energy for our ring solutions. This graph has a
single turning point, precisely at the point at which the large ring
turns into a small ring. The slope of the curve turns from positive
(for the large ring) to negative (for the small ring) in upon
passing through the turning point, consistent with our conjecture
about the stability properties of plasmarings. More generally,
fig.\ref{turn:fig} is qualitatively similar to the equivalent graph
of \cite[fig.6(b)]{Arcioni:2004ww} for black hole and black rings in
flat 5 dimensional space, except that the large black ring curves
back down as we increase $\tL$. This difference has no impact on
stability analysis, as the turning point method links instabilities
to vertical tangents rather than horizontal tangents (even though a
heat capacity/susceptibility changes sign as one crosses a
horizontal tangent).

 \caption{Conjugacy diagram: $\psi$ as a function of angular momentum, $\tL$
for fixed energy, $\tE=40$.}\label{turn:fig}
 \end{center}
\end{figure}

In conclusion, the turning point method indicates that the small
ring has an additional instability as compared to the large ring.
Note that it is perfectly possible that both the large and the small
ring are unstable, for example to fluctuations that break rotational
symmetry.

\section{Discussion}\label{sec:discuss}

In this paper we have emphasised that the AdS/CFT correspondence
implies a duality between nonsingular classical gravitational
solutions with horizons, and solutions to the boundary equations of
fluid dynamics. This connection has previously been utilised by
several authors to obtain gravitational predictions for various
fluid viscosities and conductivities (see, for instance,
\cite{Son:2007vk} and references therein). The new element in our
work is the incorporation of boundaries separating the fluid from
the vacuum into the Navier-Stokes equations. This feature (which
relies on the explicit gravitational construction of the domain wall
in \cite{Aharony:2005bm}) allowed us to study stationary
\emph{finite energy} lumps of plasma, which are dual to localised
black holes and black rings in the bulk.

All our work (and easily imagined generalisations) apply to
confining field theories. Stationary black holes in such backgrounds
sit at the IR ends of the geometry; the boundary shadow of such
black holes is a lump of deconfined fluid of size $R + \CO
(\Lambda^{-1}_\mathrm{gap})$. The fluid dynamic equations accurately
describe such lumps only when $R  \gg \Lambda_\mathrm{gap}^{-1}$, in
the same limit the fluid yields an approximately local
representation of the horizon. Consequently, the AdS/CFT
correspondence provides an approximately local fluid description of
horizon dynamics in the long wavelength limit. This result is strongly
reminiscent of the Membrane paradigm of black hole physics
\cite{Thorne+MacDonaldETAL-BlacHole:86, Parikh:1997ma,
Cardoso:2007ka}, and may constitute the precise version of this
conjecture in the context of asymptotically AdS spaces.

All the specific results of this paper are based on the equations of
state \eqref{thermint:eq}, which are valid for the high temperature
phase of Scherk-Schwarz compactified conformal field theories (dual
to gravity in Scherk-Schwarz compactified AdS space). However the
only qualitative feature of this equation of state that was
important for the existence of the solutions of this paper is that
the fluid pressure vanishes at finite energy density. In
fig.\ref{linvalidity:fig} we have plotted the logarithm of the
maximum and minimum values of $\ln \tloc/\tc$ in our solutions,  as a function of
energy and angular momentum. Note that at large values of charges
(and away from extremality bounds) each of these quantities tends to
zero. This demonstrates that over large classes of our solutions,
the fluid temperature is always close to the phase transition
temperature. As a consequence such solutions `sample' only the fluid
equation of state only in the neighbourhood around the zero pressure
point, and so would exist in any fluid whose pressure vanishes at finite energy density.


Our results suggest several directions for future research. It would
be interesting to analyse the stability of small fluctuations about
the solutions presented in this paper. As we have mentioned in
\S\S\ref{sec:turn}, we expect the small ring to be unstable to
axisymmetric fluid fluctuations, while we expect the ball and the
large ring to be stable to such fluctuations. However, it is quite
possible that such an analysis would reveal that the large ring
solutions of this paper have a Rayleigh-Taylor type instability that
maps to Gregory-Laflamme instabilities (see also
\cite{Cardoso:2006ks})\footnote{We thank T. Wiseman for suggesting
this.} of the dual bulk solutions.

Although we have not mentioned this in the text, there exists a
scaling limit in which the thin plasmarings solutions simplify
greatly.\footnote{We thank T. Wiseman again for pointing this out to
us.} In this limit ($\tw \ra 0$ with $\vi$ fixed), the 3D plasmaring
reduces to a straight strip of moving fluid. The fluid
pressure vanishes on this strip, and the fluid velocity is constant
across the strip (more precisely $\vo = \vi +
\frac{1-\vi^2}{2\vi^2}\tw + \CO(\tw^2)$ so that $\zo-\zi =
\frac{1-\vi^2}{2\vi^2} + \CO(\tw)$). Similarly, there should exist
scaling limit under which the 4 dimensional plasmaring reduces to an
infinite stationary cylinder, with fluid flow along the axis.
Various dynamical properties of large rings (e.g. the potential
Gregory-Laflamme type instability alluded to in the previous
paragraph) will probably prove easiest to study in this scaling
limit.

It should also be relatively straightforward, and rather
interesting, to more fully analyse the thermodynamics of the 4
dimensional solutions presented in this paper. This thermodynamics may
have interesting features; for  example, it has
been suggested that ultra-spinning black holes in 6 dimensional flat
space are unstable \cite{Emparan:2003sy} and it would be interesting
to see if the same is true of our (pinched?) plasmaballs.

An extension of our work to obtain the moduli space of 5 and higher
dimensional fluid configurations - and so 7 and higher dimensional
gravitational black solutions should also be possible (though
analytic solutions may be harder to obtain in higher dimensions).
Such an extension would yield interesting information about horizon
topologies in higher dimensional gravitational theories. An obvious
conjecture based on intuition from fluid flows would be that the
full set of stationary fluid solutions in 5 dimensions appear in
three distinct topological classes; solutions whose bulk dual
topologies would be $S^5$, $S^4\times S^1$ and $S^3\times S^1\times
S^1$. The reason one might expect the last solution is that in 5
(but no lower) dimensions, it is possible to have solutions that
rotate about two independent axes; these two rotations should be
able to create their own distinct centrifugal `holes', resulting in the
above topology. It would be
very interesting to check whether this conjecture is borne out.


%All known black ring solutions have one rotational isometry in the
%$S^1$ direction and one on the $S^2$ of their horizons. While the
%first one of these is required on general grounds, the second does
%not seem necessary. In our setup, this extra isometry maps onto
%motion around the Scherk-Schwarz circle. As the existence of black
%rings without this isometry is still an open question, it would be
%interesting to see if there are fluid configurations that break this
%symmetry. However, the size of this circle is of the same order as
%the mean free path of the gluons, so our approximations would not be
%valid for such configurations.

\section{Equations of state}\label{app:eqstate}

In this appendix we discuss the free energy, temperature etc.\ of
the plasma at rest. This is different from the free energy,
temperature etc.\ of the plasmaball/plasmaring. %Most of the notation
%in this section is therefore different from the rest of these notes.

For a conformal theory in $d$ dimensions with no conserved charges,
dimensional analysis and extensivity determine
%
\begin{equation}\label{freecnfrm:eq}
  \floc = -\lambda V \tloc^d,
\end{equation}
%
with $\lambda$ an arbitrary constant. In our situation, the plasma
is dual to the black brane, so it doesn't know about any capping off
in the IR except that the energy is measured with respect to a
different zero. Before reducing on the Scherk-Schwarz circle, it
behaves like a conformal theory in $d+1$ dimensions plus a vacuum
energy density. After dimensional reduction\footnote{Strictly
speaking, it is not a dimensional reduction as we will have plasma
temperature of the same order as the Kaluza-Klein scale. Rather, we
are restricting attention to classical solutions that do not vary in
this compact dimension.}, we have
%
\begin{equation}\label{freecnfng:eq}
  \floc = V\prn{\rz - \lambda \tloc^{d+1}}.
\end{equation}
%
This gives
%
\begin{equation}\label{therm:eq}
  \begin{split}
    P &= -\pdiffc[\tloc]{\floc}{V} = \lambda \tloc^{d+1} - \rz \,,\\
    \sloc &= -\pdiffc[V]{\floc}{\tloc} = (d+1)\lambda V \tloc^{d} \,,\\
    \eloc &= \floc+\tloc\sloc = V\prn{\rz + d\lambda \tloc^{d+1}}\,.
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
%
In terms of intensive quantities, we have
%
\begin{equation}\label{thermint:eq}
  \begin{aligned}
    P &= \frac{\rho-(d+1)\rz}{d} \,,&\qquad
    P+\rho &= \prn{\frac{d+1}{d}}(\rho-\rz) \,,\\
    s  &=
    (d+1)\lambda^{1/(d+1)}\prn{\frac{\rho-\rz}{d}}^{d/(d+1)},&
    \tloc &= \prn{\frac{\rho-\rz}{d\lambda}}^{1/(d+1)},
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
%
or, in three dimensions
\begin{equation}\label{therm3d:eq}
  \begin{aligned}
    P &= \frac{\rho-4\rz}{3} \,,&\qquad
    P+\rho &= \frac{4}{3}(\rho-\rz) \,,\\
    s  &=
    \frac{4\lambda^{1/4}}{3^{3/4}}\prn{\rho-\rz}^{3/4},&
    \tloc &= \prn{\frac{\rho-\rz}{3\lambda}}^{1/4}.
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Note that the critical density and temperature are those for which
the pressure is zero
%
\begin{equation}\label{crittherm:eq}
    \rho_c = (d+1)\rz\,, \qquad
    \tc = \prn{\frac{\rz}{\lambda}}^{1/(d+1)}.
         %= \prn{\frac{\rho_c}{(d+1)\lambda}}^{1/(d+1)}
\end{equation}
%
For the black-brane equation of state \eqref{equationofstate:eq}
%
\begin{equation}\label{braneparam:eq}
  \rz = \frac{\pi N^2 \tc^3}{512}\,,
  \qquad
  \lambda = \frac{\pi N^2}{512 \tc}\,.
\end{equation}
